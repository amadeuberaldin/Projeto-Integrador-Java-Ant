# Integrative Project: Sistema Gerenciaor de Alimentos

This project is now completed, but it represents the first version that integrates all the subjects from my Software Analysis and Development course. When I started this project, we had not yet learned about clean code practices or used JFrames. As a result, I initially had a single class containing all the system's dialogs with the user along with all the system's methods.

As the course progressed, I applied clean code practices and created user interfaces based on the initial dialogues the system had with the user. This made the program extremely complex to understand, with many screens and numerous classes. This system was undoubtedly a challenging project to work on from the beginning of the course.

Despite the challenges, this project has been a significant learning experience, allowing me to grow and improve my programming skills. It showcases my journey from understanding the basics to implementing more advanced concepts and best practices in software development.
